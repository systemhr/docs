## Start a Play

You can enable a Play using the toggle switch on the **Plays** page or from inside the **Play Editor**. 

Once enabled, lead sourcing will start automatically.

Based on your [Autopilot](/launch/autopilot) settings, leads will appear in your **Approvals** page, or progress automatically to the writing stage.


## Approvals

If you are starting with Autopilot disabled, the next step after enabling a Play is to **visit the Approvals page.**

Here you will find the leads found by your AI rep, which you can triage with the `approve` or `reject` buttons.

## Active Leads

Once a lead is approved, they will become an **Active Lead**

This means that your AI sales rep will start 'working the lead' by:
- Researching the company + contact
- Determining outbound strategy for this lead
- Writing their email sequence
- Following up when appropriate
- Monitoring for engagement

### A lead will be marked 'won' when:
- They complete the goal of your play (ex: link click, reply, or meeting)


### A lead will be marked 'lost' when:
- They reply with unsubscribe intent (i.e. 'stop')
- They click an unsubscribe link in the email
- They are manually unenrolled, unsubscribed, or archived by you in the app.
