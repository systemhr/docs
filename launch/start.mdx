## Start a Play

You can enable a Play from the **Plays** list view or from inside the **Play Editor**. 

Once enabled, lead sourcing will automatically start.

Based on your [Autopilot](/launch/autopilot) settings, leads will appear in your **Approvals** page, or progress automatically to the writing stage.


## Visit the Approvals Page

Assuming you're starting with Autopilot disabled, the next step after enabling a Play is to visit the Approvals page. 

Here you will find the leads found by your AI rep.

Once you approve leads, the AI rep will begin the research and sequence writing process, unique to each lead.

This process will happen in the background, and emails will appear on the Approvals page once ready.
