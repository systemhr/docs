<Note>
Autopilot consists of 2 separate settings. You can use Playmaker without autopilot, with just one enabled, or with both enabled.
</Note>

## Disable autopilot

Leave both settings unchecked to disable autopilot. 
- All leads will require manual approval before emails are written.
- All emails will require manual approval before sending.

## Send outreach on autopilot

When enabled, emails written by your AI rep will be automatically approved and scheduled for the next available send slot.

You can still view upcoming emails in **Inbox** -> **Scheduled**, where you will be able to edit or cancel them until their scheduled time.


## Add leads on autopilot

When enabled, leads generated by your AI rep will be automatically approved, and enrolled in email outreach if your plan has capacity remaining.


## Full autopilot

When both settings are enabled, leads will be automatically approved -> researched -> sent outreach.

You can review upcoming and sent outreach on the Inbox page.
