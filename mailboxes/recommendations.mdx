<Tip>
If your plan includes Fully-Managed Email Infrastructure, we'll handle all of this for you.

## Sales Domains
**Never send cold email from your primary domain**. Always use separate sales domains to maintain a separate reputation and mitigate risk to your business-critical emails.

We recommend starting with **3 sales domains**. If your company is company.com, for example, you could register:
- getcompany.com
- trycompany.com
- withcompany.com

## DNS Records
When registering your sales domains, it is critical to set up your DNS records to land in the inbox.

Please be sure you have configured properly your:
- SPF Record
- DKIM Record
- DMARC Record


## Mailboxes Per Domain
We recommend no more than **5 mailboxes per domain.**

## Emails Per Mailbox
We recommend sending no more than **25 emails per day per mailbox**

For Mailboxes connected recently, the limit will automatically start at 10 emails per day per mailbox, and will automatically ramp from there.


## Email Warmup
It is critical to keep all Mailboxes connected to an Email Warmup service for the entire duration of your outreach.
