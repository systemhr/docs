<Tip>
If your plan includes Fully-Managed Email Infrastructure, we'll handle all of this for you.
</Tip>


## Sales Domains
**Never send cold email from your primary domain**. Always use separate sales domains to maintain a separate reputation and mitigate risk to your business-critical emails.

We recommend starting with **3 sales domains**. If your company is company.com, for example, you could register:
- getcompany.com
- trycompany.com
- withcompany.com

## DNS Records
<Tip>
If you are using our fully-managed email infrastructure, we will take care of this for you.
</Tip>
When registering your sales domains, it is critical to set up your DNS records to land in the inbox.

Please be sure you have configured properly your:
- [SPF Record](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786?hl=en&ref_topic=9061731&sjid=8397682044347921886-NC)
- [DKIM Record](https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en&ref_topic=9061731&sjid=8397682044347921886-NC)
- [DMARC Record](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466580?hl=en)


## Mailboxes Per Domain
We recommend no more than **5 mailboxes per domain.**

## Emails Per Mailbox
We recommend sending no more than **25 emails per day per mailbox**

For Mailboxes connected recently, the limit will automatically start at 10 emails per day per mailbox, and will automatically ramp from there.


## Email Warmup
<Tip>
If you are using our fully-managed email infrastructure, we will take care of this for you.
</Tip>
It is critical to keep all Mailboxes connected to an Email Warmup service for the entire duration of your outreach.

If you are using your own mailboxes, we'd recommend services like [Warmup Inbox](https://www.warmupinbox.com/) or [Smartlead](https://app.smartlead.ai/).
